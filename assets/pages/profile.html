			<b>Professional info:</br></b>
			Currently I'm a Developer Consultant at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank">Thoughtworks</a> in Munich, Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. With deeper focus in Native and Hybrid development for Mobile applications, Web Frontend and UI development, as well as UX design and Game development in Unity 3D.</br>
			What defines me professionally is a very active and curious person who's not afraid to dive deep into a brand new framework or project completely far away from my comfort zone. Extremely adaptable and highly communicative, my inner drive has always been bringing equitable and inclusive technology and all its features to the service of people.

			<b>Personal info:</br></b>
			Born and raised in Campinas - SÃ£o Paulo ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· </br>
			One of my strongest social skills is being able to create a friendly and inclusive atmosphere with those I work and chat with, standing up against bigotry and creating a space where everyone feels heard and cherished.</br>
			In my free time I enjoy reading books about psychology, philosophy and Buddhism. When picking a movie or series to watch, I love picking the ones that dare the watcher to get out of their comfort zone and learn something new. Catching up with friends is also a very refreshing activity for me, which I do quite often.</br>
			And last but not least: Meditation is a very important part of my routine and my life.</br>
