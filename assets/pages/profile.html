			<b>Professional information:</br></b>
			Currently I'm a Mobile developer at app affairs GmbH. in Munich, Germany 🇩🇪. With deeper focus in Native, Hybrid and Web Front-end development, UI/UX design and Unity.</br>
			What defines me professionally is a very active and curious person who's not afraid to dive deep into a brand new framework or project completely far away from my comfort zone. My inner drive has always been bringing technology and all its features to the service of people.</br>
			</br>
			</br>
			<b>Personal information:</br></b>
			Born and raised in Campinas - São Paulo 🇧🇷 </br>
			One of my strongest personality aspects is Tolerance and Respect. I can easily get along with people regardless of their background, nationality, skin color, religion, sexual orientation, sexual identification or political view. Every human is worthy, every life is special.</br>
			In my free time I enjoy reading books about psychology, philosophy and eastern religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and all its branches, watching movies and series that dare the watcher to get out of their comfort zone are my favourite. Catching up with friends is also a very refreshing activity for me, which I do quite frequently.</br>
			And last but not least: Meditation and Yoga are a very important part of my routine and my life.</br>
